# SYNC_CACHE_OE is an rsync destination for OE downloads and archives.
# It is used by those do_build.sh steps:
# - sync_cache: rsync oe-download (tarballs) to SYNC_CACHE_OE
# - sync_cache_back: rsync oe-download from SYNC_CACHE_OE to the tree
# - packages_tree: hardlinks packages if they exist in SYNC_CACHE_OE
#SYNC_CACHE_OE=/home/builds/oe

# BUILD_RSYNC_DESTINATION is where the build output is copied to
# It is used by those do_build.sh steps:
# - copy: copies the build output to BUILD_RSYNC_DESTINATION
# - packages_tree: copies all OE packages over, except for the ones that can \
#                  be hardlinked to SYNC_CACHE_OE
